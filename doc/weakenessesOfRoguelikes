ADOM:
Escape key doesn't work
No "fire at closest target" button
Annoying message buffer
1) Typing : doesn't show up on screen when typing :m
2) You have to press space to move on to next message, but pressing it again yields an unknown command
3) Messages disappear instantly if you're moving, which is almost always
Ridiculous start difficulty
Lack of roguelike direction keys
'g' doesn't get
Picking up item when slot is empty doesn't autoequip, I guess due to cursed items, which themselves are a stupid idea 
Doesn't auto-pickup items you already possess
No subwindows
Doesn't open doors automatically

Angband:
Boring: Lack of story, subquests, classes, and level map of ADOM
Picking up item when slot is empty doesn't autoequip

Crawl:
You have to memorize indices of your inventory to do anything.

Combine interface quality of Angband with flavor of ADOM; add vim-like functionality.
